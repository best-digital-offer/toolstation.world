            <h2>Professional Image Compression Tool</h2>
            <p>Our image compressor reduces file sizes while preserving visual quality, making it perfect for web optimization, email attachments, social media uploads, and storage management. The tool uses advanced compression algorithms to achieve optimal file size reduction without noticeable quality loss.</p>
            
            <p>Image compression is essential for modern web development and digital content management. Large image files slow down website loading times, consume excessive bandwidth, and create poor user experiences. Our compressor solves these problems by intelligently reducing file sizes while maintaining the visual integrity that matters most to your audience.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Image Compression</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faster Website Loading:</strong> Compressed images load significantly faster, improving user experience and SEO rankings</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Bandwidth Usage:</strong> Smaller files consume less data, saving costs for both website owners and visitors</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Optimization:</strong> Compressed images take up less storage space on servers and devices</li>
                <li><strong>Better Mobile Experience:</strong> Smaller files load faster on mobile networks with limited bandwidth</li>
                <li><strong>Email Compatibility:</strong> Compressed images are more likely to pass email size restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Optimization:</strong> Platforms often compress images automatically - pre-compressing gives you control over quality</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Our Compression Works</h3>
            <p>Our tool uses lossy compression for JPEG images and lossless optimization for PNG images. The quality slider allows you to balance file size reduction with visual quality. Higher quality settings preserve more detail but result in larger files, while lower settings create smaller files with some quality trade-offs.</p>

            <p>The compression process analyzes your image and removes unnecessary data while preserving the most important visual information. For photographs and complex images, JPEG compression typically provides the best balance of quality and file size. For images with text, logos, or simple graphics, PNG compression often works better.</p>

            <p>All compression happens locally in your browser using HTML5 Canvas technology. This ensures your images remain private and secure - no files are uploaded to external servers. The process is fast, efficient, and works offline once the page is loaded.</p>

            <h3>Best Practices for Image Compression</h3>
            <p>For web use, aim for the smallest file size that maintains acceptable visual quality. Test different quality settings to find the optimal balance for your specific images. Consider your audience and use case - high-quality photography may require higher compression settings than simple graphics or thumbnails.</p>

            <p>Before compressing, ensure your images are properly sized for their intended use. Compressing a 4000x3000 pixel image for web display is less efficient than first resizing it to appropriate dimensions (like 800x600) and then compressing. This approach provides better results and smaller file sizes.</p>

            <p>For professional photography or print use, maintain higher quality settings to preserve important details. For web thumbnails, social media posts, or email attachments, more aggressive compression is usually acceptable and beneficial for performance.</p>

            <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
            <p>Our compressor supports all major image formats including JPEG, PNG, WebP, and others. The output format is optimized based on your input image type and compression settings. JPEG images are compressed using quality-based algorithms, while PNG images undergo lossless optimization to remove unnecessary metadata and optimize color palettes.</p>

            <p>The tool maintains original image dimensions and aspect ratios while focusing solely on file size reduction. Color profiles and basic metadata are preserved to ensure compatibility with various applications and devices. The compression process is reversible only in the sense that you can adjust settings and recompress, but the original uncompressed data cannot be recovered from a compressed image.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?</h3>
                <p>Lossy compression (like JPEG) removes some image data to achieve smaller file sizes, which may slightly reduce quality. Lossless compression (like PNG optimization) reduces file size without any quality loss by removing unnecessary metadata and optimizing data structure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What quality setting should I use?</h3>
                <p>For web use, 70-85% quality usually provides the best balance of file size and visual quality. For high-quality photography, use 85-95%. For thumbnails or small images, 60-75% is often sufficient. Always preview the result to ensure it meets your quality requirements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are my images stored or uploaded anywhere?</h3>
                <p>No! All compression happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Your images never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy and security. The tool works offline once loaded.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I compress multiple images at once?</h3>
                <p>Currently, our tool processes one image at a time to ensure optimal quality and performance. For batch processing, you can use the tool multiple times with consistent settings for similar results across all images.</p>
