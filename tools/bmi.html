            <h2>Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI)</h2>
            <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used screening tool that measures body fat based on height and weight. Developed in the 19th century by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet, BMI provides a simple numeric measure to categorize individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>
            
            <p>Our BMI calculator provides instant, accurate results using the standard BMI formula: weight (kg) / height (m)². The tool supports both metric and imperial units, making it accessible for users worldwide. Understanding your BMI can help guide health decisions and conversations with healthcare providers about weight management and overall wellness.</p>

            <h3>BMI Categories and Health Implications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Underweight (BMI < 18.5):</strong> May indicate malnutrition, eating disorders, or underlying health conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Normal Weight (BMI 18.5-24.9):</strong> Associated with lowest risk of weight-related health problems</li>
                <li><strong>Overweight (BMI 25-29.9):</strong> Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other health issues</li>
                <li><strong>Obese (BMI ≥ 30):</strong> Significantly increased risk of serious health conditions including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>BMI Limitations and Considerations</h3>
            <p>While BMI is a useful screening tool, it has important limitations. BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass, which can lead to misclassification for athletes and individuals with high muscle mass. It also doesn't account for fat distribution, bone density, or overall body composition.</p>

            <p>Age, sex, and ethnicity can affect the relationship between BMI and health risks. For example, older adults may have higher BMI ranges that are still considered healthy, while some ethnic groups may have increased health risks at lower BMI levels. These factors should be considered when interpreting BMI results.</p>

            <p>BMI is most accurate for sedentary to moderately active adults. Athletes, bodybuilders, and individuals with high muscle mass may have elevated BMI scores despite having low body fat percentages. In these cases, additional measurements like body fat percentage or waist circumference provide more accurate health assessments.</p>

            <h3>Using BMI for Health Management</h3>
            <p>BMI serves as a starting point for health discussions rather than a definitive health diagnosis. Healthcare providers use BMI alongside other measurements, medical history, and physical examinations to assess overall health status and disease risk.</p>

            <p>For weight management goals, BMI can help establish realistic targets and track progress over time. However, focus should be on overall health improvements including increased energy, better sleep, improved fitness, and reduced disease risk markers rather than BMI alone.</p>

            <p>Regular BMI monitoring can help identify gradual weight changes that might otherwise go unnoticed. This early awareness can prompt lifestyle adjustments before significant health impacts occur. However, short-term fluctuations are normal and shouldn't cause concern.</p>

            <h3>Healthy Weight Management Strategies</h3>
            <p>Achieving and maintaining a healthy BMI involves balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and stress management. Sustainable weight management focuses on gradual changes rather than rapid weight loss, which is more likely to be maintained long-term.</p>

            <p>Nutrition should emphasize whole foods, appropriate portion sizes, and balanced macronutrients. Regular physical activity should include both cardiovascular exercise and strength training to maintain muscle mass while managing weight. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week as recommended by health authorities.</p>

            <p>Professional guidance from healthcare providers, registered dietitians, or certified fitness professionals can provide personalized strategies based on individual health status, preferences, and goals. This is especially important for individuals with existing health conditions or those significantly outside normal BMI ranges.</p>

            <h3>BMI in Different Populations</h3>
            <p>Children and adolescents require different BMI interpretations using age and sex-specific percentiles rather than adult categories. Pediatric BMI assessment considers normal growth and development patterns, making direct adult BMI categories inappropriate for younger populations.</p>

            <p>Pregnant women experience normal weight gain that affects BMI calculations. Healthcare providers use specialized guidelines for healthy weight gain during pregnancy based on pre-pregnancy BMI rather than current BMI calculations.</p>

            <p>Elderly adults may have different optimal BMI ranges, with slightly higher BMI sometimes associated with better health outcomes. This reflects changes in body composition, bone density, and nutritional needs that occur with aging.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How accurate is BMI for determining health?</h3>
                <p>BMI is a useful screening tool but has limitations. It doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat mass, so athletes may have high BMI despite being healthy. It's best used alongside other health indicators and professional medical assessment for a complete health picture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's a healthy BMI range?</h3>
                <p>For most adults, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight. However, optimal BMI can vary based on age, ethnicity, muscle mass, and individual health factors. Consult healthcare providers for personalized guidance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I be concerned if my BMI is outside the normal range?</h3>
                <p>BMI outside normal ranges may indicate increased health risks, but it's not a diagnosis. Consider other factors like fitness level, body composition, and overall health. Consult healthcare providers for proper evaluation and personalized recommendations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How often should I calculate my BMI?</h3>
                <p>For general health monitoring, calculating BMI monthly or quarterly is sufficient. More frequent calculations aren't necessary unless you're actively managing weight under medical supervision. Focus on overall health trends rather than daily fluctuations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can BMI be used for children?</h3>
                <p>Children require different BMI calculations using age and sex-specific percentiles rather than adult categories. Pediatric BMI assessment should always be done by healthcare providers who understand normal growth and development patterns.</p>
